Project: Mini-Database (images):
The images in the database are all related to animals from different continents and oceans. The home page displays a map of the world where each continent and ocean is a clickable button. Clicking on a continent or an ocean takes the user to a page where they can search for animals that are in the chosen destination. Once the user has searched for an animal, it will be displayed on the screen. The sidebar displays the other continents and oceans to make it easy to move between pages without having to go through the homepage every time.
